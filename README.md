# Open Letter to the Scratch Team

This is a letter about the issues that Scratch Auth has faced being on Scratch.

Scratch Auth(incase you didn't know) is a popular OAuth provider for Scratch, notably allowing both Scratchers and New Scratchers to use its services. However, Scratch Team has not only been unsupportive of Scratch Auth as a project, but has been actively hostile towards Scratch Auth and its users.

Scratch Auth provides an immense amount of value towards Scratch, and it gets repaid with non-sense reasons, and the users of Scratch Auth have gotten warnings for the crime of mearly using Scratch Auth.

Keep in mind: I am not in this case talking about users as in Ocular or PenguinMod. I mean end-users like me and you.

For a short time, the letter was available on [the Scratch forums](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/747844). Shorty after it's publication it got closed(see [the ST's response](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/post/7864011/)), I've now sent an information request through Scratch's Contact Us page, what I sent can be seen in [`contact-us-message.txt`](contact-us-message.txt). I really do not expect any kind of response after this.
