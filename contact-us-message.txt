Hey there! I was requested to ask about the blockage of the projects 676911023, 706331591, and 728098174 via Contact Us(here) by Paddle2See(https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/post/7864011/).

I was wondering if there is a listed reason for these projects' removals, or if they could be manually reviewed to check for material that could be offending.

I feel like I should say that I am not the owner of the account that made those 3 projects.

Also: I was wondering if there was the possibility of the forum topic 597434 being reinstated.
