[b]TL;DR[/b]: Scratch Team has been suppressing Scratch Auth, an OAuth tool for Scratch that works for Scratchers and New Scratchers. This suppression includes: taking down features [i]required[/i] for Scratch Auth to work for [i]months [/i]at a time, removing the official auth projects multiple times, and alerting users for using Scratch Auth and not deleting any comments they made on auth projects or their profile.
